/**
 * AccessOverlay Component
 * 
 * This component visualizes access to food and pharmacy services by:
 * 1. Creating buffer zones around enabled POI locations
 * 2. Unioning all buffers to show total coverage area
 * 3. Calculating "deserts" (areas outside coverage) by subtracting coverage from city boundary
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Configurable buffer radius in meters
 * - Selective inclusion of different POI types
 * - Optional inclusion of farmers markets (limited hours)
 * - Green overlay for covered areas, dark overlay for deserts
 * - Uses Turf.js for geometric calculations
 * 
 * Props:
 * - cityBoundary: City limits polygon
 * - groceries/pharmacies/markets: POI data for each category
 * - includeMarkets: Whether to include markets in access calculations
 * - radiusMeters: Buffer radius in meters (800m â‰ˆ 0.5 mile)
 * - enabled: Which POI categories to include in calculations
