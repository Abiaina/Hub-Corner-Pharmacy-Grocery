- **Node.js 20.x LTS**

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Project Structure

### Routes (App Router)
